# Introduction

Overload is a distributed, scalable performance testing application. It mainly focuses on ease-of-use.
* Distributed - users don't need to handle complex cluster management - the application creates and manages the cluster by itself once deployed.
* Control - better control over QPS, connection pool, request data

Please check [deployment](deployment-cluster.md) and [getting started](getting-started.md) to begin with.
