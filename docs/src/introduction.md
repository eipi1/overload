# Introduction

Overload is a distributed, scalable performance testing tool. Users don't need to handle complex cluster
management - the application creates and manages the cluster by itself once deployed.

The application provides fine control over QPS & connection pool size - like linear increment or steps/staircase,
response assertion and details monitoring.
